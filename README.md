# gecko

Gecko is a simple cli to download all the images on a 4chan board.

Downloads images into directory at `~/Documents/pics/#{thread_number}_images`


Example Usage:
- `gecko wg 6458200`

Set up:

- Clone repository
- Copy gecko into /usr/bin/ or another directory that's in your path
- Create directory if it does not exist in: `mkdir ~/Documents/pics/`
- browse 4chan (risky step - be careful)
- run gecko: `gecko [board] [thread_number]`
